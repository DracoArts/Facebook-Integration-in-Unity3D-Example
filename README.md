# Facebook  Integration in Unity3D Example 
The Facebook SDK for Unity is an official, feature-rich plugin designed to seamlessly integrate Facebook's ecosystem into Unity games and applications. It provides developers with tools to enhance user engagement, monetization, and analytics by leveraging Facebook's powerful platform capabilities. This SDK enables functionalities ranging from social interactions (logins, sharing) to advanced advertising and performance tracking, making it an essential tool for modern game development

## 1. User Authentication & Social Integration
 ### Facebook Login

 - Allows players to authenticate using their Facebook accounts, eliminating the need for separate registration.

- Supports granular permission requests (e.g., public_profile, email, user_friends).

- Retrieves user data (name, profile picture, email, friends list) via Facebookâ€™s Graph API.

### Social Sharing
- Enables in-game sharing of achievements, scores, or custom content directly to Facebook.

- Supports deep linking, allowing users to return to the app after interaction.

- Includes game invites, letting players challenge friends to join.

### Friend Invites & Social Graph
- Access a playerâ€™s Facebook friends who also use the app.

- Implement viral growth mechanics by encouraging invites and shares.

## 2. Analytics & Event Tracking
### App Events
- Automatically logs key metrics (installs, sessions, in-app purchases).

- Custom event tracking (e.g., LevelCompleted, ItemPurchased).

- Helps measure retention, engagement, and monetization.

### Facebook Analytics (Legacy)
- While Facebook has deprecated its standalone analytics dashboard, event data is still accessible via Meta Business Suite and Ads Manager.

## 3. Monetization with Facebook Audience Network
### Ad Formats
- Banner Ads: Small, non-intrusive ads at the screenâ€™s top or bottom.

- Interstitial Ads: Full-screen ads between game levels.

- Rewarded Video Ads: Players earn in-game rewards for watching ads.

###  Ad Targeting
- Leverages Facebookâ€™s ad targeting system for higher revenue.

- Works alongside Unity Ads for hybrid monetization strategies.

## 4. Platform Support & Compatibility
- Android (min API 21)

- iOS (min iOS 13.0)

- Not Officially Supported: Windows, macOS, WebGL (limited functionality).

 Facebook is gradually shifting focus to the Meta SDK, but the Unity SDK remains functional.

### Platform Restrictions: 
Some features (e.g., deep linking) may not work on all platforms.

### Privacy Compliance:
